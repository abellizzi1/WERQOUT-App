# WERQOUT-App
Android app with multiple users that has a backend. Frontend developed with Android Studio.

**The links to the backend within the app no longer work since the database is no longer available. Our group recorded a video of the app's functions and how it works. Click on the image below to watch the video.**

## App Information
The WERQOUT app was made for people who want to create and manage gym communities.

### Types of Users and Features
There are 3 types of users: Athlete, Coach, and Gym Owner. 

**Athlete:** An athlete can be part of a team that a coach has created and can view the upcoming workouts for that team.

**Coach:** A coach can create teams, add/remove athletes in a team, and add/remove workouts in a team.

**Gym Owner:** A gym owner can create and manage gym events that both coaches and athletes can view. Also, a gym owner can view and manage all the teams at their gym.

### Features Available to All Users
**Profile:** The user can view and edit their information on this page.

**Search:** The user can view all athletes, coaches, teams, events, and gyms on this page. They can also leave ratings on any team or gym.

**Messages:** The user can message any other user. This feature uses a websocket and it also displays if the user is online or offline.

### More Information
This was a group project in COM S 309 at Iowa State University taught by Simanta Mitra. Each group had 4 members, with 2 on frontend and 2 on backend. Colin Brenizer and I (Angelo Bellizzi) developed the frontend, and John Schraderbacher and Evan Uhlmeyer developed the backend. Each file has an @author tag at the beginning with comments explaining what everything does, so it's easy to see who programmed each file. Files that I developed are in the directory Frontend/WerqoutFrontend/app/src/main/java/com/example/werqoutfrontend

### Project Award
This project won honorable mention for best project in the class. There were 50+ teams in this class.
